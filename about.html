  <h2>What is Spectra Class Of?</h2>
  <p>The <b>“Class of 2016”</b> is a photographic project with one simple goal: showcasing graduation as a rite of passage, but also as the beginning of something new, new dreams, new aspirations, new life.
  <br>But the project does more. We have purposefully decided to showcase this right of passage through the eyes of Women of Colour (WoC) at the University of Oxford.

  <h2>Why Oxford?</h2>
  <p>Many myths exist about Oxford, an institution often seen as elitist and mysterious, a beacon of academic excellence. This year it ranks second in the Times World University Rankings.
  <br>These myths tell us what Oxford is supposed to be. A place where weird interview questions are asked, a place that is a bit magical because of the old imposing buildings where students either study too much or party too hard.
  <br>But for many who spend three years or more at that University, Oxford is a beginning. A beginning of something new, a place where new friends are made, where you are going to be tested and challenged and are going to learn about yourself and what you might want to do once you’re done studying.
  <br>Oxford is also where the idea of SPECTRA began.

  <h2>Why Women of Colour?</h2>
  <p>Graduation from University is an important step for anyone who has the privilege to go to University. Women of all backgrounds go to University nowadays.
  <br>But it is hard to not acknowledge that when we think about women at Oxford, we rarely think about women of colour. They are hard to see around, but they do exist and their stories deserves to be told.
  <br>Some of their stories are very much known. The stories of the Benazir Buttos and the Aung San Suu Kyi well known by the public. But some are completely forgotten. And we believe they are worth telling, especially the stories of those who have just finished university and are officially at the beginning of their adult lives.
  <br>The media undoubtedly still has a long way to go when it comes to the representation of Women of Colour. They are underrepresented and when they are, stereotypes ignore the variety of experiences they live. This project aims to do just that: represent a segment of women of colour, a segment made of academic attainment and a reality made of ancient buildings, ancient libraries and pretty -and at times intimidating - colleges and new beginnings.
  <br>The “Class of 2016” is part of SPECTRA’s first monthly theme named “Beginnings”.
  <br>Thank you to all who decided to participate in the project - from those who posed for the photos to the amazing photographers who have made it possible. Thank you. None of this would have been possible without you.
