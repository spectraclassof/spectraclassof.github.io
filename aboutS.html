  <h2>What is Spectra?</h2>
  <img src="Images/spectratable.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="spectratable">
  <p><b>SPECTRA</b> is an online media platform set on changing how women and people who identify with womanhood are represented in the media.
  Our Mission is 'Bringing You Women in Colours'.</p>
  <p>We plan to bring colour and dimension to stories of women in all shapes and forms. We want to be a community where women can access story-driven content that celebrates and reports stories of women around the world.</p>
  <p><b>SPECTRA</b> was born out of frustration over the way in which women are portrayed in the media. We know that women are underrepresented in the media, and when they are present, too often they are seen as mono-dimensional, fitting rigid stereotypes and embodying tropes.</p>
  <p>Rarely we look at our screens and see the different realities of women portrayed fairly and accurately. This is where SPECTRA want to step in. Women are not all the same. There are different realities that women face everyday and they approach these realities with different perspectives. And we want to provide those women and their stories with a platform where they can shine.</p>
  <p>A Spectrum is "a band of colours, as seen in a rainbow” or refers to “ a wide range”. The name Spectra, therefore, fits perfectly with what we are trying to achieve, projecting a vibrant visual brand that will live up to the women we wish to represent. </p>
  <p>Women come in all colours, shapes and sizes, and they are all individual human beings with dreams, thoughts and feelings that are unique to them. There is more than a single spectrum. There are many: class, race, politics, sexual orientation, country of origin, and abilities are all factors that make women different, unique. The name SPECTRA represent all these facets.</p>
