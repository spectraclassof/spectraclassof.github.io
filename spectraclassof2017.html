      <h3>What does graduation mean to you?</h3>
      <p>Graduating signifies the beginning next chapter of my life. It is also a symbolic ending to the last four years of my life.</p>
      <h3>What is the trajectory you see for yourself?</h3>
      <p>I will be starting at Deloitte in Singapore in September and hope to pursue an MBA in a couple of years.</p>
      <h3>What impact has university had on you?</h3>
      <p>The past four years at university has helped me develop and mature as an individual. Furthermore, it has allowed me to develop life skills to deal with challenging situations whether it be working in a team to achieve a common goal or completing assignments before deadlines.</p>
      <h3>Which are your most potent memories of university?</h3>
      <p>My most potent memories range from handing in my 8000 word thesis to organising a ball with a team of fellow students. Perhaps the common theme running through all of them is the fact that I achieved something significant, in my perspective and each of those achievements has allowed me to develop valuable skills.</p>
      <h3>What gives you impetus?</h3>
      <p>I am motivated by challenging situations which require dedication and handwork.</p>

      <h3>What does graduation mean to you?</h3>
      <p>It means an end of an era and the beginning of a new one. It means the realisation of something that I have dreamt of doing - going to university - since I was 5. It is an achievement not only for myself but for a family. It is the result of my efforts combined with the faith and support I have gotten from the people around me.</p>
      <h3>What is the trajectory you see for yourself?</h3>
      <p>Success, a family of my own perhaps? I don't know. I realised not too long ago that you can only plan so much. Life has always a way to change and mess up the plans that you have. If you asked me last December what trajectory I see for myself I would have described events and plans vastly different from the ones I have now. For the moment I know I'll be starting an internship in Seoul in August that could turn into a full time job; and I know I have to work and make SPECTRA the best it can be.</p>
      <h3>What impact has university had on you?</h3>
      <p>I entered university as a colour-blind convicted conservative with no understanding of race, gender, or anything really. I grew up sheltered and somehow privileged despite my working-class parents. Now I leave university as a convicted feminist, still centre-right but no longer affiliated with any party, and proud to call myself Afro-Italian. University has opened up my mind to a whole world out there and none of this would have been possible without the random conversations I had with friends, or with random strangers, or simply without listening to what other people had to say.
      <h3>Which are your most potent memories of university?</h3>
      <p>Having conversations switch from the most mundane of topics to the most academically rigorous topic in a few seconds. Performing my poem at an exhibition on sexual violence that I had helped organise for the It Happens Here campaign. Feeling drained and amazing after handing in my 12,000 words thesis on American presidential elections. I could go on forever. I guess the running thread of my most potent memories is the fact that I was being challenged, I was bettering myself and I was growing.</p>
      <h3>What gives you impetus?</h3>
      <p>My family. I jokingly tell my parents that I have won the birth lottery. My parents are my inspirations, and so are my grandmother who is sadly no longer with us. They didn't have the chance of an education. So I'm doing this for them as well as me.</p>

      <h3>What does graduation mean to you?</h3>
      <p>Graduation for me marks the end of an epic struggle and is a massive achievement in my eyes. University has been a particularly turbulent time. I've battled with bereavement, depression, illness, anxiety, disappointment at my underachievement academically, and a whole host of other trials that accompany entering into your early 20s. Essentially, it’s been like riding a unicycle, uphill, drunk, and blindfolded, whilst balancing ‘The Complete Works of Shakespeare’ on my nose. Graduation represents an accomplishment in my life that is not purely academic, it is the reward for my resilience in the face of all the obstacles that life has put in my way over the last three years. It marks my escape from a place that has been the origin of some of my most sacred memories and some of my deepest pain. The ceremony itself is for my mother and my grandmother, without whom I would never have had a hope of getting as far as I have done.</p>
      <h3>What is the trajectory you see for yourself?</h3>
      <p>I'm an ambitious and uncompromisingly creative person and so I want to hit the ground running as soon as I enter the job market. I'm currently looking for a job in media or advertising in London. I know that long term I will probably never be completely satisfied working in a corporation and so ideally I would either like to set up my own events company or go into writing and illustrating children's literature. I'm not naive and what with the uncertainty brought about by the EU Referendum and the turbulence of current affairs I realise that it is in my best interest to build myself a firm foundation for the future.</p>
      <h3>What impact has university had on you?</h3>
      <p>My experiences at university have been forced me to grow up way before my time, which at times has been incredibly isolating because my development has occurred way before my peers. It has made me realise that my greatest asset is my own strength. Going to Oxford has been an incredibly humbling experience. When you get your offer it definitely inflates your ego and suddenly everyone is telling you that you’re among the world’s best and brightest. My actual university experience brought me down to Earth and made me realise that humility, kindness, empathy and integrity are qualities that are far more desirable than a high ELAT score or a first class degree.</p>
      <h3>Which are your most potent memories of university?</h3>
      <p>In the second term of my first year my boyfriend, Kieran, died in an accident. It was a life defining moment. Some of my most potent memories come from the way in which my friends pulled together and supported both me and everyone else who was affected by it. I was very fortunate in joining Brasenose College as I immediately found my place in a large group of friends who are fierce, and funny, and outrageous in all that they do. I have an abundance of memories with them from over the last three years, but among the best was our transformation of one of our student rooms in the a fully functioning cocktail bar complete with neon signs, a drinks fountain, and an inflatable palm tree.</p>
      <h3>What gives you impetus?</h3>
      <p>My impetus comes from my own belief in self improvement. You should wake up everyday with the conviction that you can and should strive to achieve greater things than the day before, to learn more, to push yourself harder. Your drive has to come from your own belief in your own abilities.</p>

    <h3>What does graduation mean to you?</h3>
    <p>It's the culmination of many years of hard work, stressful times - and happy ones!</p>
    <h3>What is the trajectory you see for yourself?</h3>
    <p>I'm about to begin my first job at an educational charity, which is exactly the kind of work I always saw myself doing. After that, I'm hoping that whatever I end up doing, I'm able to find ways to combine work that I love, with ways to address issues in our society affecting women and People of Colour.</p>
    <h3>What impact has university had on you?</h3>
    <p>University has brought me into contact with so many amazing people, from so many different backgrounds. I've learned as much from them (maybe more) than I have from my books and tutors, and the entire experience has helped me to really examine my own beliefs, views, and sense of identity.</p>
    <h3>Which are your most potent memories of university?</h3>
    <p>I have distinct memories of events, but the most potent memories I carry are those of feelings: the satisfaction of having an amazing conversation with people you instantly click with, the panic-defeat-victory rollercoaster over each essay crisis, the "ah" moment walking past a beautiful Oxford site and realising how special this place is.</p>
    <h3>What gives you impetus?</h3>
    <p>Knowing that what I am doing is important - whether it's because of the nature of what I'm doing, or because it shows others after me, particularly girls of colour (shoutout to my niece!) that they can achieve as much as they want to, although it won't be easy, and that there are people who will help them and support them in their endeavours.</p>
